// Outputs are like this

End
Timeout
Promise 3 resolved
Promise 1 resolved
Promise 2 resolved



-> Start
first line prints this initially

-> End
We know setTimeout is an browser api which goes to event queue for execution and wait under callstack because of eventloop mechanism of JS, so it prints first 

-> Timeout
under callback queue setTimeout is first thing with 0ms time to run, which contains Timeout 

-> Promise 3 resolved
promise3 is resolved immediately with a timeout of 0 milliseconds.
promise1 and promise2 have timeouts of 1000 and 2000 milliseconds,

-> Promise 1 resolved
promise1.then have a callback that logs "Promise 1 resolved" to the console when promise1 is resolved, its time is 1000 less then Promise2 

-> Promise 2 resolved
promise2.then attaches a callback that logs "Promise 2 resolved" to the console when promise2 is resolved, its time is 2000 more than promise1
